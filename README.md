Audulus patches.

All patches are free to good homes.

Note: that downloading .audulus files from this repo using your web browser mangles them.  You need to git clone the repo and then copy from your local location.

I am using iOctoCat to grab the repo and directly transfer the files to Audulus on the iPad.
